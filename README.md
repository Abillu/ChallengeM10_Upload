# Cryptocurrencies Clustering 
The K-means algorithm  is used in this data analytics to cluster financial assets in the form of cryptocurrencies according to their performance to assemble cryptocurrencies investment portfolios.
This machine learning algorithms  is enhanced by applying the principal component analysis.

## Methodology and Approach
Used the elbow algorithm  to find the best value for k(clusters) using the Original Data and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) data respectively.

Clustered cyptocurrencies with K-means using the Original Data.

Optimized clusters with Principal Component Analysis.

Visualization and comparison of the results.


## Libraries and Technologies Used

- Pandas library -  a Python library for data analysis. 

- hvPlot - visualization libraries. 

- Scikit-learn library - for PCA module and Kmeans clustering and StandardScaler. 

- Jupyter notebook

## Summary of findings 
The analysis established that the Principal Component Analysis optimized the identification of clusters using the K-means algorithm and eased the visualization of those clusters.
